# Vulnerable Proxy Project

A demonstration project showcasing SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities and their mitigation through a proxy server. This project implements a security pattern where a proxy server acts as a protective layer between clients and a vulnerable application.

## System Architecture

```
[Attacker] → [Proxy] → [Vulnerable App]
   (8000)     (8000)      (5000)
```

The system consists of three main components:

1. A vulnerable Flask application with SQL injection and XSS vulnerabilities
2. A proxy server that filters malicious requests before they reach the vulnerable application
3. An attacker script that demonstrates both normal and malicious requests

## Components

### Vulnerable Application
- Runs on port 5000
- Simple Flask application with SQLite database
- Contains two vulnerable endpoints:
  1. Login endpoint (SQL Injection vulnerable):
     ```python
     @app.route("/login")
     def login():
         # Vulnerable because it uses string concatenation
         query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
     ```
  2. Comment endpoint (XSS vulnerable):
     ```python
     @app.route("/comment", methods=["GET", "POST"])
     def comment():
         # Vulnerable because it displays user input without sanitization
         return "<h1>Comments</h1>" + "<br>".join(comments)
     ```

### Proxy Server
- Runs on port 8000
- Acts as a reverse proxy to the vulnerable application
- Implements two modular filters:
  1. SQL Injection Filter:
     - Checks for SQL injection patterns in request parameters
     - Blocks requests containing malicious SQL patterns
  2. XSS Filter:
     - Checks for XSS patterns in both GET and POST requests
     - Blocks requests containing malicious HTML/JavaScript
- Can be configured to enable/disable each filter independently
- Uses a modular filter system:
  ```python
  # filters/__init__.py
  from .sqli_filter import is_enabled as sqli_enabled, detect_attack as detect_sqli
  from .xss_filter import is_enabled as xss_enabled, detect_attack as detect_xss
  ```

### Attacker Script
- Demonstrates both normal and malicious requests
- Tests the proxy's filtering capabilities:
  1. SQL Injection Tests:
     - Normal login attempt
     - SQL injection attempt
  2. XSS Tests:
     - Normal comment submission
     - XSS payload submission

## Building and Running

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/memahdii/vuln-proxy-project.git
cd vuln-proxy-project
```

2. Build and run the containers:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

## How It Works

### Request Flow

1. **Normal Login**:
```
Attacker → Proxy → Vulnerable App
[admin | adminpass] → [Check: No SQLi] → [Execute Query] → [Login Successful]
```

2. **SQL Injection Attempt**:
```
Attacker → Proxy → Blocked
[admin' OR 1=1 -- | anything] → [Check: SQLi Detected] → [403 Forbidden]
```

3. **Normal Comment**:
```
Attacker → Proxy → Vulnerable App
[Hello, this is a normal comment.] → [Check: No XSS] → [Display Comment]
```

4. **XSS Attempt**:
```
Attacker → Proxy → Blocked
[<script>alert('XSS')</script>] → [Check: XSS Detected] → [403 Forbidden]
```

## Vulnerabilities and Mitigation

### SQL Injection Vulnerability
The vulnerable application uses string concatenation to build SQL queries:
```python
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '{username}' AND password = '{password}'"
```

This allows SQL injection attacks like:
```
username=admin' OR 1=1 --&password=anything
```

### XSS Vulnerability
The vulnerable application has a comment system that stores and displays user input without proper sanitization:
```python
@app.route("/comment", methods=["GET", "POST"])
def comment():
    if request.method == "POST":
        text = request.form.get("text", "")
        comments.append(text)
    return "<h1>Comments</h1>" + "<br>".join(comments)
```

This allows XSS attacks like:
```html
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
```

### Mitigation
The proxy server implements filtering for both vulnerabilities:

#### SQL Injection Filter
Checks for common SQL injection patterns:
- OR/AND conditions
- Comment markers (--)
- UNION statements
- Common tautologies (1=1)

#### XSS Filter
Checks for common XSS patterns:
- `<script>` tags
- Event handlers (onload, onerror, etc.)
- JavaScript protocol handlers
- Malicious HTML attributes

## Configuration

Both filters can be enabled/disabled using environment variables in `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
proxy:
  environment:
    - ENABLE_SQLI_FILTER=1  # 1 to enable, 0 to disable
    - ENABLE_XSS_FILTER=1   # 1 to enable, 0 to disable
```

## Development Notes

### Python Module Structure
The proxy server uses a modular filter system:
1. Each filter is implemented as a separate Python module in the `filters` directory
2. The `__init__.py` file makes the directory a proper Python package
3. The `PYTHONPATH` environment variable is set in the Dockerfile to ensure Python can find the modules
4. Filters are imported and used in `proxy.py` using absolute imports

### Adding New Filters
To add a new filter:
1. Create a new Python module in the `filters` directory
2. Implement the required functions:
   - `is_enabled()`: Check if the filter is enabled
   - `detect_attack()`: Implement the attack detection logic
3. Add the filter to `filters/__init__.py`
4. Update `proxy.py` to use the new filter

## Expected Output

When running the project, you should see:

1. Normal login attempt:
```
Testing normal login:
[admin | adminpass] → 200 | Login successful
```

2. SQL injection attempt:
```
Testing SQL injection:
[admin' OR 1=1 -- | anything] → 403 | Blocked by SQLi filter
```

3. Normal comment:
```
Testing normal comment:
[Hello, this is a normal comment.] → 200 | Accepted
```

4. XSS attempt:
```
Testing XSS injection:
[<script>alert('XSS')</script>] → 403 | Blocked by XSS filter
```

## Security Note

This project is intentionally vulnerable and should only be used for educational purposes. Do not deploy it in production environments.
